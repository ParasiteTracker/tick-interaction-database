Clifford et al. (1973) consider Ixodes affinis a Nearctic species, but this is erroneous since its description is based on material obtained in Costa Rica. Ixodes affinis is closely related to Ixodes fuscipesand Ixodes pararicinus, making it difficult to identify with certainty. Rodríguez-Vivas et al. (2016) in Mexico and Polsomboom et al. (2017) in Belize found Ixodes near affinis, suggesting that more than one species may be rep- resented under this name. More recently, Saracho-Bottero et al. (2020) identified as Ixodes cf. I. affinis specimens from northeastern Argentina previously classified as Ixodes pararicinus. Those authors found three populations ofIxodes cf. I. affinis, one in Argentina, another in Colombia-Ecuador, and a third population in Belize-USA that differ at the molecular level from one another and probably from bona fide Ixodes affinis, but found no morphologically significant differences to separate the populations investigated. Most probably the name Ixodes affinis represents a species complex. See also Ixodes pararicinus.	TRUE		10.11646/zootaxa.4871.1.1. PMID: 33311340.	Guglielmone AA, Petney TN, Robbins RG.

Ixodes auritulus has a worldwide distribution that includes the Afrotropical Region in Camicaset al. (1998, under the name Scaphixodes auritulus) and Guglielmone et al. (2014), although records of its pres- ence on Afrotropical islands were considered misidentifications in Wilson (1970). More than one taxon is included under this name, as suggested by Arthur (1960c), and supported by differences in the morphological definition ofIxodes auritulus among authors. Dumbleton (1961) named specimens collected in New Zealand as Ixodes auritulus zealandicus. Ixodes auritulus sensu stricto is from southern South America (Punta Arenas, Chile) (Neumann, 1899, 1904). Keirans and Clifford (1978) recognized Kohls and Clifford (1966) as the first describers of the male of Ixodes auritulus, but there are at least four prior descriptions, although none from the type locality. See also Ixodes kergue- lenensis and Ixodes percavatus for their confusion with Ixodes auritulus and the Ixodes auritulus species group.
